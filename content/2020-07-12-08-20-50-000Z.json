  "content": "When I read this I see a a niche, super premium hardware company that managed to acquire tens of thousands of customers by word of mouth. Not only that, their customers are all in-effect self employed or small businesses with huge average revenue per employee. They manage global supply chains, intense competition, all while taking on and managing huge legal/compliance risk. How is is that supposedly \"dumb,\" criminals can do this, and yet many of us are stretching our intellectual capacities to learn new technologies and maths, developing our nth stupid app, trying to achieve a fraction of the customer traction and revenue that street thugs manage to do every day. Are these people much smarter than average, or does it mean that if you sell something people actually want, literally nothing else matters about your intelligence, education, character, background, or anything at all. When I read these drug stories, it just reinforces for me that growth solves everything. You can succeed with a crew of violent, drug addicted idiots whose only reliable characteristic is short term thinking, and who spend half their time in prison if you have product market fit. What I'm beginning to think is that the \"smarter,\" people are in a company, the less anyone will want their product. It's like the success of a venture is inversely proportional to the number of ostensible geniuses it employs. reply <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23711867\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">How Police Secretly Took over a Global Phone Network for Organized Crime | Hacker News</a>",
