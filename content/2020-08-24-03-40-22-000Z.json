It relates to forgiving actions that were taken, that gave you the feelings of loss of control over your happiness. It’s about acknowledging those things that another did or said that caused pain and making the decision that you are not going to let that hurt or control you anymore. Forgiveness can be very empowering. It can give you the chance to be free of another person’s emotional control. It has nothing to do with the other person. As was said before, it is something that is for you and you alone.\" <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23996505\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Why forgiving someone else is about you | Hacker News</a>"
